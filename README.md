# swaysterwebscraping
A script used to gather scholarship and athlete ranking data from the ESPN website

Functions for adding athletes and scholarship data with the Bubble data API are included in the test.js file and the scraper.js file.
The scraper.js file contains all of the code needed and should be self explanatory so long as you know something about the Node Puppeteer web scraping library
